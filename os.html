There is a company called <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jpaerospace">JP Aerospace</a>
which is actively working on Airship To Orbit program which aims to lower the cost of lifting
mass to orbit from today's 1000$/kg to 0.31$/kg. One issue of this system is that the journey
to orbit will take nine days, but it can easily be resolved by deploying multiple ATO systems
at once. The other issue is that this system may not reach orbital speed at all. Nobody has
tried accelerating 2km-long airships to orbital speed at the edge of space before, so it is
a bet whether this will work or not, but I think it is a bet worth taking. Even if ATO will
turn out to not be able to reach orbit it still could be used as an launch assist for
something like a

<a href="https://www.science20.com/robert_walker/can_giant_airships_accelerate_to_orbit_jp_aerospaces_idea-225058">Here</a>
is a more detailed description of ATO. I wish that one of the space billionaires would recognize
JP Aerospace, would buy them and deploy the tests much faster than they are planned right now.<br><br>
There is over 9000 tons of space junk in the Earth's orbit, most of it is steel and aluminium.
Why not deploy a special robots to laserly weld those debris into one big piece and use that
piece as a counterweight for a momentum exchange thether?
